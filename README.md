# TheWeekenders

A travelling recommendation engine. We usually decide travel destinations based on what activities do we want to do.

With machine learning (ML) its easier to find insights and correlations. Hence we decided to use Collaboative Filtering (CF) algorithm to make a recommendation engine for recommending activities along with cities & cost of that activity on the basis of user selected activity.

So basically, we'll recommend activities that are similar to the user's selected activity.
